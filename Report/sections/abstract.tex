\section{Abstract}
Minimally invasive thoracic surgeries often face challenges of limited visibility and access, traditionally addressed through invasive procedures such as rib removal, which increase recovery time and postoperative complications. This project introduces a dynamic thoracic camera system designed to enhance surgical precision and reduce invasiveness by providing real-time feedback and precise actuation. The system integrates a Raspberry Pi 5 for image processing and computer vision to track surgical tools and a Raspberry Pi Pico for motor control and sensor feedback to actuate a slim, maneuverable camera mounted on a tension-controlled platform. Stepper motors adjust tension wires monitored by load cells, ensuring balanced operation and smooth camera movement. A web-based interface allows surgeons to operate the system in manual or automatic modes, providing intuitive controls and live system monitoring. By eliminating rib removal and enabling precise control, this system improves the efficiency and safety of thoracic surgeries. This report details the projectâ€™s design, implementation, and performance, alongside challenges encountered, team contributions, and opportunities for future enhancements such as 3D visualization and advanced robotic integration.
